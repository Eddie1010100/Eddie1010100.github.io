Lab 07 

Lab 7, part 2, parking.cc was an interesting lab because I was curious how parking meters worked and how they were programed since they are such a simple system but common everywhere and I found it interesting how computer science was a part of that so said system.

Lab 12 

Lab 12, part 01 is interesting because I did not fully know that gifs and color was possible by coding, certain aspects of coding in a certain color can be combined to make an image that can move with those colors because the coding aspect can repeat infinite number of times to make the image and the colors associated with that image move.

Lab 03
Lab 3, part 1 pizza.cc was really interesting because similar to lab 07, I was curious how people were able to charge people on a register for food with a simple click and this lab was able to show me the coding aspect behind fast food places for when you place an order the food and the the exact need information like price and item are coded in it to make the cashiers job extremely easier than having to remember it so lab 03 was one of my personal favorites.
